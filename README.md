# FoodWasteManagement
In a world where the statistics of food waste are extremely high, we want to help to reduce this waste of food. With our combined skills and dedication, we want to create a website where people can connect with each other and share to food they have left

 * My focus in this project was on developing the backend part, where I was responsible for designing and implementing the server-side logic. I developed the API endpoints and implemented security features such as authentication and authorization to ensure a safe and controlled user experience.
